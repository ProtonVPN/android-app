  // Multiple inheritance of Link is intended for objects that play a
  // receiver role for multiple interfaces (such as the server-side
  // client instance object), and for this reason RECV common base
  // classes such as RC should be virtually inherited.
  // Usage of Link may create a memory reference cycle between
  // Link-derived objects and the SEND object.  Therefore be sure
  // to manually break cycles as part of an explicit stop() method.
