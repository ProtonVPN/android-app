CMOCKA
=======

cmocka is a fork for Google's cmockery unit testing framework to fix bugs and
support it in future.

For information about how to use the cmocka unit testing framework see
doc/index.html.

COMPILING
---------
To compile the cmocka library and example applications run, create a build dir,
and in the build dir call 'cmake /path/to/cmocka' followed by 'make'. On
Windows you can use the cmake gui. More details can be found in the INSTALL file.
