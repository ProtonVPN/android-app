# You must specify one of two possible network
# protocols, 'dev tap' or 'dev tun' to be used
# on both sides of the connection.  'tap' creates
# a VPN using the ethernet protocol while 'tun'
# uses the IP protocol.  You must use 'tap'
# if you are ethernet bridging or want to route
# broadcasts.  'tun' is somewhat more efficient
# but requires configuration of client software
# to not depend on broadcasts.  Some platforms
# such as Solaris, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X only
# support 'tun' interfaces, so if you are
# connecting to such a platform, you must also
# use a 'tun' interface on the Windows side.

# Enable 'dev tap' or 'dev tun' but not both!
dev tap

# This is a 'dev tap' ifconfig that creates
# a virtual ethernet subnet.
# 10.3.0.1 is the local VPN IP address
# and 255.255.255.0 is the VPN subnet.
# Only define this option for 'dev tap'.
ifconfig 10.3.0.1 255.255.255.0

# This is a 'dev tun' ifconfig that creates
# a point-to-point IP link.
# 10.3.0.1 is the local VPN IP address and
# 10.3.0.2 is the remote VPN IP address. 
# Only define this option for 'dev tun'.
# Make sure to include the "tun-mtu" option
# on the remote machine, but swap the order
# of the ifconfig addresses.

# key must match on both ends of the connection,
