/**
 * A static facade for a logger.
 *
 * It allows easy access to logging anywhere in the code base without any assumptions on the actual
 * logging implementation. This allows logging to be used in code that is unit tested (the default
 * implementation does nothing).
 *
 * Typically an Application subclass creates a real logger implementation and sets it by calling
 * setLogger().
