/**
 * A mechanism for delegating showing a Snackbar to another activity.
 * Typical use case is when an activity closes and wants to show a message confirming that an
 * action has been performed (e.g. "Bug report sent"). The message is shown in a Snackbar in
 * the next activity on the back stack that is resumed.
 * A delegated snack is valid only for a few seconds so that if it doesn't have a chance to display
 * right away it won't appear anywhere later.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   in the delegating activity:
 *
 *     fun onSuccess() {
 *       delegatedSnackManager.post("Saved", true)
 *       finish()
 *     }
 *
 *   in all activities:
 *
 *     override fun onCreate(...) {
 *       ...
 *       DelegatedSnackHelper(this, viewBinding.root, delegatedSnackManager)
 *     }
