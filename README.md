# ProtonVPN for Android

Copyright (c) 2019 Proton Technologies AG

## Build instructions
- Install sdk, ndk, cmake, swig
- Clone this repository
- `./gradlew assembleProdDebug` or open and build in Android Studio

### Build release
To complete a release build signing keys need to be provided:
./gradlew assembleProdRelease -PkeyStoreFilePath=<keystore> -PkeyStoreKeyAlias=<alias> -PkeyStorePassword=<pass> -PkeyStoreKeyPassword=<key-pass>`

### Rebuild strongswan
This project is using native libraries from [open-source project Strongswan](https://www.strongswan.org/).
To simplify the build process we include prebuilt copies of those libraries [here](app/src/main/jniLibs). To rebuild them follow these steps:
- `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` in the main directory (we include original Strongswan repository as a git submodule)
- `cd strongswan` and follow [build instructions](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/AndroidVPNClientBuild) from Strongswan to rebuild native libraries
- after a successful build, run `cp -r strongswan/src/frontends/android/app/src/main/libs/* app/src/main/jniLibs` in our main directory to copy the prebuilt libraries and rebuild the ProtonVPN client

## Code style
Project uses agreed code style ProtonStyle.xml for java. Import it in Android studio via ```File>>Settings>>Editor>>Code style>>Import Scheme```
For kotlin's code style we use ktlint with default rules

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please keep in mind the following rules:
- Try to stick to the project's existing code style and naming conventions
- The code base is mostly written in Java, but we are transitioning to Kotlin, so new code should be written in Kotlin where possible
- Our preferred tech stack is Kotlin, MVVM, data-binding and coroutines, so any new features or large refactors should conform to this preferred tech stack
- After adding/updating open source dependencies run `gradlew updateLicensesJson` to update attributions.

Internally our CI automatically checks all pull requests for code style issues, and runs our tests. However you can run those locally as well.
```bash
gradlew checkstyle
gradlew detekt
gradlew test
gradlew androidTest
```
